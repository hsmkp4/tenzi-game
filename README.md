# Tenzi 3d game

you can playing this game and enjoy it. glhf [Tenzi-game](https://tenzi-game.netlify.app).

## game description

It is based on tenzi game rules, but in a different UI!, it is so EZ, 1- you must make all of these 10 numbers show the same number; then 2- all of these numbers must hold (if they were not held, they change after each roll). After this 2 step, you win and your time's in what level of game makes you better than your mates.ðŸ˜Š

## code detail's

This game is scaffolding by react library. For most of the UI, react-three-fiber is my main tool, but threejs is his father, and used a little in this project; btw without threejs it was so hard to reach this level of work.
Also for numbers animation, I used react-spring, which is a great combination with r3f.
